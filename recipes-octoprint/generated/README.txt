The recipes in this folder are autogenerated using "pipoe".
Unfortunately pipoe doesn't do proper dependency resolution, so it's best to let "pip install"
figure that out and then run pipoe in the --no-deps mode that I patched in.

# make a new venv and activate it
python3 -m venv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate

# install octoprint to venv
pip install OctoPrint

# generate requirements.txt
pip list --format freeze | egrep -v '^(setuptools|pip)=' >requirements.txt

# remove old recipes
rm -f *.bb python3-versions.inc

# generate new recipes
pipoe --no-deps -r requirements.txt

Then update bbappend files in recipes-octoprint/appends as needed
